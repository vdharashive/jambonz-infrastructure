# packer-homer

A [packer](https://www.packer.io/) template to build an AMI that runs [homer](https://github.com/sipcapture/homer) VoIP monitoring stack.  The base linux distro is Debian 11 (bullseye).  The packer script can build any of the following configurations:
- an "all in one" AMI that includes homer, postgresql, telegraf, influxdb, and grafana.
- a homer-only AMU that includes homer, postgresql, telegraf and sends statistics to a remote influxdb/grafana server
- an influxdb/grafana AMI that includes influxdb and grafana, receiving data from a remote homer server via telegraf

The default settings will build an all-in-one server.

Additionally, the [Node-RED](https://nodered.org) graphical application development environment can be installed as an option to any of the above configuration.  Whilst application is a distinct and seperate function from application monitoring, to reduce the number of EC2 instances it may be desirable in some installations to run Node-RED on the monitoring server.  

> For those not familiar with Node-RED, it is a low-code application develoment tool that can be used to build jambonz applications. 

## Installing 

```
$  packer build -color=false template.json -var 'homer_password=ShnqaYuivIiyd'
```
Builds an all in one AMI

```
$  packer build -color=false template.json -var 'homer_password=ShnqaYuivIiyd' \
-var 'install_influxdb=no' -var 'influxdb_ip=55.209.23.30'
```
Builds a homer-only AMI that sends data to an influxdb service at http://55.209.23.30:8086

```
$  packer build -color=false template.json -var 'homer_password=ShnqaYuivIiyd' \
-var 'install_homer=no'
```
Builds an influxdb/grafana AMI
